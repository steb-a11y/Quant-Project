What we did:
Divide into Subreddits ->
	Within each subreddit, find the percent of bots to humans. bot/human count.
	And find each subreddits average positivity.

Then, look at each subreddit and compare the rate of bots to positivity.

What you need to do:
Add one line to each subreddit breakdown, avg sentiment score in each subreddit, then just print it out.
ex:
-----------------------------------
Subreddit: pics
Total Comments: 81
Bots: 41.98% (34)
Humans: 58.02% (47)
Avg sentiment score: 0.47
-----------------------------------
NOTE: example is NOT correct, just a random number I made up.
